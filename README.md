# journals-frontend

A Single Page Application to be used with the edx/journals service application.

## Introduction



The purpose of this repository is to illustrate general front-end best practices for [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) and [`Redux`](https://redux.js.org) applications using a handful of (overly) simplified examples.

We are currently using `node v8.9.3` and `npm@5.5.1`.

## Getting Started

To get started, run `make up` and checkout `http://localhost:1991`
